- Set up linting
- Set up Playwright
- Set up Storybook

- Write up explanation of linting
- Fix git email and update prior commits to be associated with correct account

## Mid-term

- Update README to explain project and running it
- Swap NPM out for a faster package manager such as pnpm
- Set up Zod and write examples

## Long-term

- Investigate if Bun is stable for Nuxt 3 projects. If so, determine if it's worth replacing Node/NPM with it
