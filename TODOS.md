# TODOS

## Short-term

- Fix following error in `pages/index.vue`:

`Module '"/home/ciaran/code/nuxt-3-base/components/core/c-button.vue"' has no default export.ts-plugin(1192)`

- Set up Playwright
- Set up Storybook

## Mid-term

- Update README to explain project and running it
- Swap NPM out for a faster package manager such as pnpm
- Set up Zod and write examples
- Write up explanation of linting

## Long-term

- Investigate if Bun is stable for Nuxt 3 projects. If so, determine if it's worth replacing Node/NPM with it
