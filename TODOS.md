# TODOS

## Short-term

- Set up linting
- Set up Playwright
- Set up Storybook
- Set up Husky
- Check if stylisticJs in ESLint replaces Prettier

## Mid-term

- Update README to explain project and running it
- Swap NPM out for a faster package manager such as pnpm
- Set up Zod and write examples

## Long-term

- Investigate if Bun is stable for Nuxt 3 projects. If so, determine if it's worth replacing Node/NPM with it
